### Title: Introducing DeepWeb: Your AI Assistant for Firefox

We're excited to announce the launch of DeepWeb, a Firefox extension that seamlessly integrates AI chat capabilities into your browsing experience. With support for ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek, DeepWeb transforms how you interact with web content.

#### Why We Built DeepWeb

The modern web is full of information, but making sense of it all can be overwhelming. We found ourselves constantly switching between browser tabs and AI chat interfaces, copying and pasting content, losing context along the way. DeepWeb solves this by bringing AI assistance directly to any webpage.

#### Key Features

**Multi-Model AI Support**: Access ChatGPT for creative tasks, Claude for analysis, and DeepSeek for technical queries - all from a single interface.

**Smart Context Extraction**: DeepWeb intelligently extracts content from the current page, allowing you to ask questions, get summaries, or request translations without manual copying.

**Privacy by Design**: Your conversations never leave your device. API keys are encrypted with AES-256, and we don't collect any usage data.

**Beautiful, Responsive Interface**: Choose from light, dark, or system-matched themes. The interface adapts perfectly to any screen size.

**Prompt Templates**: Save time with pre-built templates for common tasks like summarization, code explanation, and language translation.

#### Getting Started

1. Install DeepWeb from the Firefox Add-ons store
2. Add your API keys in the settings (encrypted locally)
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Y on any webpage to start chatting

#### Open Source

DeepWeb is fully open source. We believe in transparency and community-driven development. Check out our GitHub repository to contribute, report issues, or see how it works under the hood.

#### What's Next

We're just getting started! Upcoming features include:
- Conversation history search
- Custom prompt template creation
- Export options for conversations
