## CSS Variables Used

The theme system uses CSS custom properties that are dynamically updated:

- `--theme-primary`: Primary brand color
- `--theme-secondary`: Secondary color
- `--theme-accent`: Accent color
- `--theme-error/warning/info/success`: Status colors
- `--theme-background-default/paper/elevated`: Background variations

- `--theme-divider`: Border and divider color
- `--theme-overlay`: Overlay background color
- `--theme-shadow`: Shadow color

## Features Implemented

1. **Theme Persistence**: Selected theme is saved to browser storage
2. **Smooth Transitions**: Theme changes animate smoothly
3. **System Preference Detection**: Can follow system dark/light mode
4. **Custom Themes**: Users can create custom themes (basic implementation)
5. **Import/Export**: Themes can be exported as JSON and imported
6. **Reduced Motion Support**: Respects user's motion preferences
7. **Theme-specific Adjustments**: Each theme can have unique characteristics
